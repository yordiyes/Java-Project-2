# College Registration and Course Manipulation System

Welcome to the College Registration and Course Manipulation System! This Java project aims to streamline the registration process for students and provide comprehensive course management functionalities for college administrators.

## Getting Started

Before running this code, ensure that you have included the necessary dependencies. Specifically, you need to include the JAR file for the database connection in the `.lib` folder. This JAR file facilitates the interaction between the application and the database, enabling seamless data operations.

## Functionality

### Student

The primary functionality available to students includes:

1. **Registration**: Students can register for courses through the system. They can select the courses they wish to enroll in based on their academic requirements and preferences.
   
2. **Viewing Registered Courses**: After registration, students can view the list of courses they have successfully registered for. This feature helps students keep track of their academic schedule and ensures they are enrolled in the correct courses.

### College Head

The college head possesses additional privileges compared to students. These privileges include:

1. **Adding Courses**: The college head can add new courses to the system. This functionality is essential for incorporating new subjects into the curriculum or accommodating changes in academic requirements.
   
2. **Deleting Courses**: If a course becomes obsolete or redundant, the college head has the authority to delete it from the system. Removing outdated courses helps maintain an up-to-date and efficient course catalog.
   
3. **Updating Courses**: Course details such as title, description, credit hours, and prerequisites may need to be modified over time. The college head can update existing courses to reflect any changes accurately.
   
4. **Viewing Courses**: Along with the manipulation capabilities, the college head can also view the entire list of courses available in the system. This provides a comprehensive overview of the college curriculum and facilitates informed decision-making.

## Usage

To utilize the system effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Student Registration**: Students should register themselves in the system using their credentials provided by the college administration.
   
2. **Course Registration**: Once registered, students can log in and proceed to view the courses for which they have registerd.
   
3. **Course Manipulation (College Head)**: College heads can log in with their administrative credentials to access the course manipulation functionalities. They can add, delete, update, and view courses as necessary to maintain an efficient course catalog.
